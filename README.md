Cyber Safety Awareness and Reporting Initiative for Goa

CYBER-RANGER is a dedicated, community-driven web platform focused on combating rising cyber threats in Goa. We provide local, actionable information on common scams (like UPI fraud, fake job offers, and digital arrests) and offer a clear, immediate pathway for citizens to report and recover from incidents.

This project is built to promote digital literacy and aligns with SDG 4: Quality Education by providing practical safety guidance to students, seniors, professionals, and small businesses across the state.
